I know love is different to you
'Couse love can be frightening
That's true
But take me as your brother and your friend
And take me as your lover and your man

Pretty young girl on my mind
How I wish you to be mine
Girl, you're no child anymore

Pretty young girl on my mind
Don't you know, know I can't hide
Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl
And you're sixteen
